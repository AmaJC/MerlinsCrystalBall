Hello! 


Welcome to the page for the Welcome-back/What's-up/What-is-61B/Work-on-MCB Webcast!

We're going to catch up, have 61B FAQ, and work on a little project which will give you a little sneak peek into what 61B is about. 

Officially I'll start at 9:00PM PST, but I'll probably be online and derping around at 8:30PM. (Times are flexible XD)


We'll cover:
    General FAQ
    Creating a github account and using terminal commands (Linux) (Running commands and programs from basic terminal)
    Differences between 61A and 61B
    Java vs Python
    The structure of the overall class
    OOP review
    Open-sourcing
    Coding challenges (mostly interview related)(regex)
    Walkthrough of Merlin's Crystal Ball.  Fairly similar to Project 1, and can touch on several key themes of 61B and Java.
    How to contribute! :D  (I've left a bunch of easy tgame functionality/assertions undone for you guys to try out if you're interested in some practice)
   
   
General timestamp:
9:00PM - 9:30PM  - General class description FAQ and a look at some old assignments from the summer
9:30PM - 10:00PM - Open-Sourcing/61B-ing 101: Using GitHub, 
10:00PM+ Make/work on analysis.py-s
 
 
8:00PM-ish - I'll be online for you East-Coasters :P
Else-wise if you'd like to kick it but you can't make the time, let me know! (Do they even allow GH in China?)
If there's enough demand, I'll have another stream on Monday/Tuesday where I manually copy the entire framework into Java.  Basically watching me type for an hour.
