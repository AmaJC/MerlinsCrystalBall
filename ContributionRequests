Hello!

I opted to use python to encourage open-sourcing from the shiny 61A alums.  
If there's enough demand, I will do another webcast of me copying much of the framework onto Java for the students taking 61B next semester.

For students: feel free to try any of these out.  Take a look around main.py and play around with it.  Add stuff or break stuff!
Also, I expect all of you to create an analysis.py for review and 61B warm-up.  I plan to try to make a network out of all your analysis algorithms combined. :)


If you'd like to contribute, some ideas are listed below.  If you have questions, feel free to shoot me a message.

Check out the #Problem tags on main.py. I've set them up to be fairly straightforward, or at least what you'd find on a lab.

These problems are slightly longer and more complex. 

1. Percival Role support: take input for ambigous knowledge of Merlin/Morgana.  Account for their votes and determine Merlin from Morgana
2. Player number options: Full support for 5,6,7,8, or 9 player games.  <- Fairly straightforward, but a bit of architectural work. 
3. GUI: Graphical user interface.  Front-end isn't quite my thing as of now. 
4. Accusation: Allow the user to manually accuse a player of being a spy, returning a probability that the player is a spy and calculating future games and missions as such
5. Neural Network, using either metadata from games, or metadata from old player profiles
6. Name-number assignments: Allow the user to input names instead of numbers, and map the names to the character numbers. (This is currently not an option mostly for speedy data input)
7. Android App (in the near future)
8. Apple Phone compatibility
