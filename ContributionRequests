I'm working on a diagram to help with understanding.  This would probably be a bunch cleaner in Java, but I opted for python to encourage open-sourcing from my students.


If you'd like to contribute, some ideas are listed below.  If you have questions, feel free to shoot me a message.

1.  Percival: take input for ambigous knowledge of Merlin/Morgana.  Account for their votes and determine Merlin from Morgana
2. 7, 8, or 9 player game compatability. <- Fairly straightforward, but a bit of architectural work. 
3. GUI: 
4. Comments/recommendations on plays, analysis, or ways to identify spies
5. Accusation: Allow the user to manually accuse a player of being a spy, returning a probability that the player is a spy and calculating future games and missions as such
6. Neural Network 
7. Name-number assignments: Allow the user to input names instead of numbers, and map the names to the character numbers. 
8. Android App (in the near future)
9. Apple Phone compatibility
