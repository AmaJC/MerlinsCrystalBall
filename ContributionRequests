Hello!

I opted to use python to encourage open-sourcing from the shiny 61A alums.  
If there's enough demand, I will do another webcast of me copying much of the framework onto Java for the students taking 61B next semester.

For students: feel free to try any of these out.  Take a look around main.py and play around with it.  Add stuff or break stuff!
Also, I expect all of you to create an analysis.py for review and 61B warm-up.  I plan to try to make a network out of all your analysis algorithms combined. :)


If you'd like to contribute, some ideas are listed below.  If you have questions, feel free to shoot me a message.
Check out the #Problem tags on main.py

1.  Percival: take input for ambigous knowledge of Merlin/Morgana.  Account for their votes and determine Merlin from Morgana
2. 7, 8, or 9 player game compatability. <- Fairly straightforward, but a bit of architectural work. 
3. GUI: 
4. Comments/recommendations on plays, analysis, or ways to identify spies
5. Accusation: Allow the user to manually accuse a player of being a spy, returning a probability that the player is a spy and calculating future games and missions as such
6. Neural Network 
7. Name-number assignments: Allow the user to input names instead of numbers, and map the names to the character numbers. 
8. Android App (in the near future)
9. Apple Phone compatibility
