#In a game based on social deduction,  visual cues, deception, and unpredictability,  can a minions intent be revealed by careful objective analysis?

#In the long run, MCB will use TensorFlow to observe and predict behavioral patterns of spies using player metadata from past games.
#Currently, this program uses a primitive system known as Suslevel™.  
#As the program tracks plays, players will be given SusPoints™ for suspicious behavior which has been previously identified
