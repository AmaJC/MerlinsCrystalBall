If you want to complain about the bad architecture, go ahead. I changed the framework several times in the design so it's a tad messier than I anticipated. :P

Amanda:  Hopefully knowing the game will help you draw connections.  Try writing some analysis functions based on logic you use in-game.  I have confidence in your ability, kid.

Nethen: Don't stress about 61B. XD You'll be fine.  Just take a look around and see what you can understand, and maybe try implementing something.  Hope to see you on Sunday!

Szechuan Sauce: You're going to learn a lot of this in 61B.  Do your best to understand what's going on.  I don't recall that you understand the game that well so don't stress it too much.


Max: high expectations, kid.  Go crazy.

Pranav: You can try building a neural network if you have the time to learn TensorFlow.  That being said, it's probably a lot harder if you're not quite familiar with the game. 

Christina: Feel free if you have the time! I'm really curious to see your creative side of CS.  I've seen some impressive book work from you.

Janet: don't touch mai code


just kidding.  take a look around! I'd love to see what you can come up with! :D


Good luck! Enroll in CSM! Let me know if you have any questions! Super proud of you guys and looking forward to the next semester! :)
